- Conducted technical interviews for engineering candidates, with my work being used as the technical interview prompt
- Wrote a technical design document for each project (1-2 per quarter), incorporating stakeholder feedback and signoffs
- Conducted code reviews for other engineers, and engaged in pair programming with junior and senior engineers
- Continued to support each project post-launch as API updates and customer issues came up over time
- Triaged on-call firefighting requests on a quarterly rotation, fixing bugs with unfamiliar parts of the codebase
- Integrated and took ownership of multiple end-to-end payment processor integrations, including Stripe, Klarna, Alipay
    - Single handedly took Klarna integration from planning process to shipped and live within 3 business days, resulting in up to a 105% increase in checkout cart value from customers
    - Collaborated with Stripe engineers to research and implement a fraud prevention flow for Alipay
- Revamped internal tools internationalization UI to increase business user efficiency by 500%
- Collaborated with external partners at Lokalise to ensure localization was being properly delivered in EFIGS, Chinese, and Russian, expanding our userbase more than tenfold
- Implemented site redesigns, collaborating and communicating with stakeholders on product and design each step
    - Redesigns worked on include Humble Bundle (humblebundle.com) sitewide navigation, marketing/landing pages for various promotions including Humble Choice (flagship subscription service), payment processor menus sitewide, and many more
    - Maintained contact with internal and external stakeholders, including product, design, and QA
- Reorganized sitewide navigation on backend, allowing business side users to customize the elements and dropdowns in sitewide navigation via an internal UI
- Restructured backend and frontend data for Humble Choice redesign - changed flagship subscription service that previously allowed users to choose 9 of 12 available items to unconditionally give the user all included items, removing the “choosing” step. The launch of this product increased userbase size by 5% month on month.
- Implemented user side OAuth integration with external partner Epic Games, allowing users to claim purchased content using an external account
